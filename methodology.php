                    <p> 		Our approach to teaching your kids includes Play And Learn. Utilizing state-of-the-art technologies, we empower kids to succeed. Our methodology is unique, we include in our curriculum more than the traditional 3 Rs (reading, writing, and arithmetic). Our focus is to bring collaborative, hands-on, real-world problem-solving activities into the classroom. Kids enrolled at our classes work together with their teachers and other children to learn and share experiences in a fun way.
	 
								It is important to provide a good foundation at an early age by exposing young children to many of new concepts. TechKids was established to achieve this goal. We integrate key 21st century skills into the classroom. On top of the TechKids core subjects and traditional schools subjects TechKids adds the 4 Cs: Collaboration, Creativity, Communication, and Critical Thinking.
								 
								TechKids implements STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) curricula in our system to keep kids competitive globally by incorporating 21st century skills.  We encourage curiosity, discover technology, and develop leadership and critical thinking among children.
								 
								TechKids is not only a school for learning tech but it is a technology education lab that enables children to discover the basic principles of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in a fun and interactive environment. The same reason, we research and evaluate latest developments in educational technology; source innovative tools from across the world; and using our experience as educators, we design a hands-on play and curriculum to educate and inspire child.
